Repository Name: teaching_support_codes

Description:
This repository contains Python scripts and computational tools developed to support undergraduate and postgraduate chemistry teaching. The codes are designed to facilitate conceptual understanding through visualization and simulation of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. Topics covered include reaction dynamics, concentrationâ€“time profiles, first-order kinetics, and numerical modeling of molecular systems. These resources aim to complement theoretical instruction with interactive and computational demonstrations.
